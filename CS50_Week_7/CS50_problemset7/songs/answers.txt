I would characterize their audio aura as high energy and generally good for dancing.
This may not be representative of the listener as I am making my basis from looking over the table and describing generally what I see. I am not taking into account every single data point.
A much better way would be to use sqlite3 commands to average the energy, valence, and daceability and then average those results. This number could then be uniquely associated with
an aura type.
