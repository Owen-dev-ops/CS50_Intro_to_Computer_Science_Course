sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:

- I know because in the best case scenario for bubble sort, the array is already perfectly sorted. I tested sort 1 on each txt file of size 5000
and noticed it worked the quickest on the sorted list, and slowest on the random list and reversed list. I ran it multiple times and this result was
consistent.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:

- Sort2 is very efficient regardless of the size of the list. And, it takes the same amount of time to sort each list regardless of its initial order.
Merge sort handles large arrays effectively which sort2 has proven it does. Merge sort also consistently runs in O(n log n) time complexity even for
the worst case, and sort2 takes the same amount of time to sort each list regardless of initial order.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:

- One, by process of elimination, and two because selection sort always has O(n^2) time complexity regardless of the initial order of an array and
sort3 takes the same time to run regardless of which list of txt we use it on. (Same time for each list of the same correlating size of course.)
Selection sort faulters when arrays become larger as well and sort3 takes the longest on the 50000 element txt files. Longer than both sort1 and sort2.
