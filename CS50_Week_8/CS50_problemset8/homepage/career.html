                        I am an entrepreneur who is developing his tech skills in hopes of opening his own tech company one day.

                        I'm an aspiring tech entrepreneur with a passion for building and problem-solving. My journey began in high school as a cashier,
                        but I quickly transitioned into entrepreneurship by flipping furniture. I sourced, refurbished, and sold used furniture through
                        online marketplaces, handling everything from logistics to customer service. This hands-on experience taught me the value of grit,
                        creativity, and customer focus.
                        <br><br>
                        Over time, I realized my true passion lies not just in refurbishing, but in building—especially in the digital world.
                        I made the decision to pivot, taking a full-time job as a Metro Banker while studying computer science. I'm currently
                        enrolled in Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course, and I’m working toward a tech apprenticeship to deepen
                        my skills and gain real-world experience.
                        <br><br>
                        My goal is to launch my own tech company—one that solves meaningful problems and creates lasting impact. I'm always
                        looking to connect with like-minded individuals, mentors, and opportunities in the tech space.
