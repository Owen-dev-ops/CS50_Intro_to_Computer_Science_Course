                        Fairly easy for me now (when I started climbing this was the highest I was able to go), it's
                        like climbing a ladder except some of the rungs are missisng. In this problem the holds are good and
                        so to complete I just had to be mindful of where my feet are and then explode to the last hold. An easy
                        and fun warmup.

                        V3 Grade: Slightly difficult for me. A noticeable difference happens once you start climbing at
                        this grade and above. To start jugs (which are holds you can fully get your hand around) mostly go away.
                        In this climb only the last couple holds are jugs. But the rest are what are known as slopers. There is
                        nothing to grab. So to be able to climb with these holds you'll see I have to fully place my hand on them
                        and then lean as far away as I can (making sure to lock my arms straight). If you try to pull up on a sloper
                        you'll fall (unless your super strong).

                        Mid level difficulty for me. V4s require more advanced movement and problem solving. As you can
                        see in this problem I have to be incredibly technical with how I move my body. Placing my weight just slightly in
                        the wrong direction will cause me to fall. Notice as well there isn't much to grab onto within this problem, it's
                        more so about pressing into the wall to create tension. Clever problem solving is needed more than strength
                        to solve a problem like this one... although more strength never hurts.

                    <p>
                        Hard difficulty for me. This is my main project grade (I project V6's as well but rarely
                        have much success). In this climb I was incredibly fresh and so was able to do it first try. Within that
                        session I may add. During the previous session I worked on this problem for about an hour maybe totalling
                        two to three dozen attempts to no avail. So I was quite happy after topping out this climb.
